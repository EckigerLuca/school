						I had my first encounter with video editng in 2018, which was also the year where I uploaded my first YouTube Video.
						<br>
						Also in this year, I decided to learn how to use After Effects to create those <a href="https://youtu.be/s8XIgR5OGJc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trap Nation</a> like Audio Visualizers. This somehow got me into making somewhat professional Intros with Cinema 4D and After Effects. You can watch it <a href="https://youtu.be/D6Gx3osCGSw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!
						<br>
						Since that video achieved some views, some random guy who I met on TeamSpeak decided to scam me, yay... I made an Intro and Outro for him and he decided to completely block me off after I sent him the renders. That was the end for now...
						<br><br>
						Also in 2018 someone who I met on a Minecraft Server asked me if I wanted to join his project. Soon after that conversation had I turned into a Co-Owner of a Minecraft Server and had gained some experiences with Linux Servers. I then tried to learn Java so I could help with Minecraft Plug-Ins, well that didn't went as good as planned and so I abandond coding and focused on other things. Shortly after that, the project died.
						<br><br>
						I then managed to join another project as a Moderator on a Minecraft Server, <a href="http://infinityheroes.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfinityHeroes.de</a>. I left by the end of 2018 because of inactivity and to focus more on school. It was still pretty nice though ♥

						The 11th March 2020, official begin of the Corona Pandemics.
						Due to Lockdowns and schools being closed, I had enough time to start coding, again. But this time with a goal, my own, free, non pay-to-win <a href="http://discord.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> Bot!
						<br>
						And with the creation of the Bot Account <code>Darling#2476</code> on the 12th of August a really big journey began. I watched so many YouTube tutorials to get an idea on how to code a Discord Bot and then I found something perfect for me, <a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Discord.py</code></a>. Thanks to this Library I managed to build my first real application, and it worked well! The bot quickly reached 20 Servers, but sadly Discord made some big changes by the end of 2020.
						<br><br>
						2020 was also a big year of designing, I started to create the somewhat "cringy" anime edits, of which some actually kinda blew off, I mean I always try to deliver the highest quality I can.

						Still locked down, Discord announced some HUGE Api changes. By turning the <code>Message Content Intent</code> (needed to fetch commands, e. g. <code>!help</code>) into a privileged one, they forced Devs to use the new Slash Commands until April 2022. Around eight months left to do something but sadly the maintainer of <code>Discord.py</code> announced to abandon the library.
						<br>
						Now, there were two options, wait until something happens <u>or</u> switch libraries.
						<br>
						I decided to switch to be safe since I wanted to make my Bot "big". But what to use? Around that time <a href="http://github.com/sillysoon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silly (SillySoon)</a> started to code his own bot for fun, but using <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Node.js (JavaScript)</code></a>. I learned how to use Node and recreated Darling in JavaScript using <a href="http://discord.js.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discord.js</a>.
						<br>
						And on the 9th November I released Darling with Slash Commands.
						<br><br>
						I also had my first collab in 2021 with <a href="http://github.com/Sniperspyder2550" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry (Sniperspyder2550)</a>! (I promise you, we will continue Cryptoreun soon&trade;)
						<br>
						Anyway, 2021 is almost over, I met many people, continued Darling and added some new stuff. I even hit 40 Servers on Christmas!!

						Here we are, 2022. I announced some big features like a Dashboard right before New Year's Eve, so I started to learn how to use HTML and CSS. This went quite well, but since then no new update arrived. I was simply yo lazy UNTIL I found my way back to InfinityHeroes:
						<br>
						They were searching for someone who could create a bot that connects their website with their Discord server in order to publish announcements on the website. This was in 2021, however the part in 2022 is more important because I actually maintained the project and so <a href="https://github.com/ifheroes/discord-website-bot-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discord-website-bot-js</a> was born. Shortly after that, I was added to their GitHub Team and at that point I finally had my shit togheter.
						<br>
						I started working on the website of Darling, but not just a website, a website with a Dashboard to manage the Bot!
						<br>
						In June, everything was done, except the homepage which still is not done. I'm kinda ashamed of that fact...
						<br>
						Well, maybe this September or October <code>Darling 2.0</code> will roll out, who knows.
